#### Introduction

The original vision of this project was to create a model that predicted whether bookmakers' handicaps under- or overvalued certain teams in a manner that we could hypothetically profit from. However, due to constraints in time and our novice skill level at the time, we had to pare down our project to the prediction of NBA game outcomes based on publicly available game data. However, this project lays the groundwork for future exploration of our original project's intentions.
